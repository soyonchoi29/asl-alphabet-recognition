# asl-alphabet-recognition

This program was written for the purpose of teaching the machine to recognize the hand through the device webcam and display the detected ASL letter onto the screen. Several different SVM models were trained with the Kaggle ASL Alphabet dataset found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grassknoted/asl-alphabet/metadata?resource=download). Because this project has not been programmed for practical use and more for testing and research, the code may not be user-friendly.

To run the program, run the main.py file and sign to the webcam. The program should identify the ASL letter being held up by the user, albeit not 100% accurately.

This project was conducted for the Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship program at Amherst College, under Professor Scott P. Alfeld. More information about the research done on this topic can be found on the poster [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wI8KXGUvWXBA-xkj9gM9eK53F58ALkPZmD-PW0Q8XYE/edit?usp=sharing).
